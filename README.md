## Key Features

- **Review Analysis**: Processes and analyzes text reviews to detect authenticity.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Allows users to upload and classify reviews via a web-based dashboard.
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

## How the Project Works

### Conceptual Flow

1. **Data Input**:
   - The system accepts datasets of product reviews (in `.csv` or `.json` format).
   - Features such as review text, timestamps, and reviewer IDs are extracted.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removes noise, stopwords, and performs stemming/lemmatization.
   - Converts text into numeric vectors using NLP techniques.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trains machine learning models on labeled datasets (genuine vs. fake).
   - Saves the best-performing model for predictions.

4. **Review Classification**:
   - Takes new reviews as input and classifies them as **Genuine** or **Fake**.
   - Displays results in the web application interface.
